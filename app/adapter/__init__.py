"""
This package contains adapter modules for the application.

Adapters are used to interface with external systems or libraries.
They act as a bridge between the domain logic and external services,
ensuring that the domain logic remains decoupled from external dependencies.

For example, the RUTValidatorAdapter class adapts the RUT validation logic
from the domain layer to be used in the application layer.
